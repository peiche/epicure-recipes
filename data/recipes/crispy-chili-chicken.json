  "description": "Here is the ultimate fake-out on takeout! Crispy chicken rice bowls ‘n wraps can cost you upwards of $20 a pop at a fast-food joint once it’s all said and done. But, cooking at home doesn’t just save you cash—it’s a smart way to stick to your health goals without sacrificing flavor. This at-home recipe isn’t just about making the satisfying, crispy bits in the wok, either: we’re all about that perfect blend of sweet heat and smokiness.",
