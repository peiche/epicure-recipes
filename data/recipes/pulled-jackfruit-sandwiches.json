  "description": "Jackfruit is the plant kingdom’s answer to pulled pork or chicken, with a meaty texture that’s ideal for soaking up all those smoky, spicy and saucy flavours we’re about to throw its way. They’re great for meat eaters and veg heads alike. But it’s a bit spicy; use a little less seasoning, if you prefer it mild.",
