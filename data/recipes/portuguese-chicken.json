    "If you have time, let the chicken rest for 15 min before slicing it. This gives it time to absorb the yummy juices. Pour any drippings from the steamer over your chicken.",
    "Don’t waste the bones! Boil the leftover carcass in water to make a bone broth. Bone broth contains collagen and may help support your immune system, digestion, and joint health"
