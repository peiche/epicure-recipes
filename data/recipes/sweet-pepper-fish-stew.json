  "description": "This playful twist on Brazilian fish stew (Moqueca) puts frozen and canned foods to good use. Please use frozen fish—it’s less expensive than fresh and melds better into the silky, tomato-coconut milk base. With kid-friendly flavours, this recipe is an easy way to introduce more fish at mealtime. FYI: fish is packed with protein, vitamins, and nutrients that can lower blood pressure and promote heart health.",
