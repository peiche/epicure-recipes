        "Fuel up first thing and stay fuller longer with rich smooth-tasting vanilla blend. Made with pea and fava bean protein, this blend turns into a velvety shake (just mix with water or milk) or morning smoothie with a luscious creamy texture, not chalky like a lot of other protein powders. It’s made with heat-stable probiotics which means baking with benefits! Add to pancake, waffle, muffin, or cookie batters. Power up your morning with an extra boost from 20 g of plant-based protein and essential amino acids.&nbsp;"
