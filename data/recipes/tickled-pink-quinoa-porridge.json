    "Divide quinoa between four bowls. Thin out with more milk, if desired. Top with apple slices, yogurt, whole food topper, and maple syrup, if desired."

    "If you have time, rinse and drain quinoa before cooking. This will help remove saponin, a natural coating, which can make quinoa taste bitter.",
    "Don’t cover the quinoa with a lid as it cooks in the microwave; it will create too much steam and may spill over the sides of the steamer.",
    "Soy milk is comparable to dairy milk in terms of protein content. If using another milk such as almond, rice, or cashew, serve with 1&frasl;2 cup Greek yogurt."
