  "description": "Our favourite little chef, Remy the rat, will be blown away by this presentation. Cottage cheese is whipped until it’s as airy as a cloud and then topped with Ratatouille. This recipe is a fun and elegant (and, not to mention, protein-packed) way to serve a classic, French, veggie dish when entertaining guests.  To save time, prep Ratatouille ahead of time—when it’s time to dish it up, simply re-heat it on the stovetop or in the microwave.",
