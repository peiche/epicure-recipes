    "Ever heard of cold brewed tea? It's much smoother because the cooler temperature slowly extracts flavour over several hours, which helps prevent a bitter or astringent taste. Place 1–2 tea bags per cup of cold water in a sealed container. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight. Use within 4 days of brewing.",
    "To chill glasses, rinse with cold water and freeze for 10 minutes."
