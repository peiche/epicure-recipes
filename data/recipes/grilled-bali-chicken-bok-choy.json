    "Look for bok choy in the produce section of the grocery store. You might find two varieties: a white-stemmed type, which comes in both a large size and a small size called baby bok choy, and a green-stemmed type called Shanghai bok choy, which comes in a size between baby bok choy and regular bok choy. You can swap these varieties interchangeably in this recipe."
