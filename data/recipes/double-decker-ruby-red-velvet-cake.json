    "Let cakes cool completely while preparing icing. You can place them in the fridge to speed up the process.",
    "To make icing, in a medium bowl, use an electric mixer to beat cream cheese and butter until smooth. Beat in vanilla and icing sugar, one spoonful at a time, until smooth.",
    "When cakes have cooled completely, spread a spoonful of icing in the centre of a cake plate or pedestal. Place one cake on top. Spread half the icing over top of cake. Gently place remaining cake on top. Spread remaining icing over top of cake just to the edges. If there is leftover icing, you can ice the whole cake or freeze for another day."
