No need to grab a frying pan — just pop the top and shake on the taste of bacon with way less sodium, zero cholesterol, and no artificial flavors or colors (unlike popular brands).&nbsp;These crunchy bites are layered with smoky bacon flavor and are an amazing addition to salads, potatoes, eggs, and more!&nbsp;"
