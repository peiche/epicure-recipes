    "For the curd, in a 4-Cup Prep Bowl, whisk eggs until foamy. Add mix and water; whisk until well combined. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 2 min, until thickened, whisking halfway through and at the end. If the curd has not thickened after 2 min, cook for additional 30 sec intervals, whisking after each, until desired thickness is achieved. Whisk in butter, if desired. Cover; refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or until cooled.",
    "For the icing, in a bowl, using an electric mixer, beat cream cheese and butter until blended.",
    "Add icing sugar and lemon curd. Beat on low just until mixed, scraping down the side of bowl as needed. Overbeating will make icing too soft.",
    "Spread icing onto baked goods as desired. If making ahead, cover and refrigerate up to 3 days."
