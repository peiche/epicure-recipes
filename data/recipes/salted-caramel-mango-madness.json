        "We like to fuel our bodies and satisfy our sweet tooth with the decadent salted caramel flavour of this pea and fava bean protein. It blends effortlessly into a morning smoothie with a creamy texture, not chalky like a lot of protein powders. It also handles the heat, so we can bake it into a batch of waffles and enjoy our day knowing that we'll have that extra boost from 20 g of plant-based protein and essential amino acids.&nbsp;"
