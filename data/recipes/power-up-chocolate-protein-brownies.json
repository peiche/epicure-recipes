  "description": "Power up with these epic brownies when you need to satisfy a craving! They’re vegan; low sugar; and egg, gluten, and peanut free, so they’ll work for almost everyone. And, they’re packed with 4 grams of protein, so you’re getting the most out of your sweets—protein slows the absorption of glucose to help you avoid a sugar spike (and crash!). Serve with a dollop of prepared Summer Berry Sweet Dip for a little extra sweetness.",
