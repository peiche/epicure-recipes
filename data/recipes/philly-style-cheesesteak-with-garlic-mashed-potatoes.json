  "tips": [
    "To save time, purchase pre-sliced beef. Be sure to look for \"stir-fry\" beef as opposed to \"stewing\" beef; stewing beef will be very tough to use to prepare this recipe. If pre-sliced beef is unavailable, freeze your favourite cut of steak until firm, about 30—45 min. This will make it easier to thinly slice the meat."
