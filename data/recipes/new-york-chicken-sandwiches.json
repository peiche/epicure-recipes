  "description": "Here’s an Epic take on a popular New York street sandwich called “chicken spiedie” (pronounced “spee-dee”). This grilled meat on a skewer is renowned for its bright lemony and herby flavour that typically takes hours of marinating. Our streamlined version slashes prep and cook time, and still delivers a punch of flavour! Bump up the fibre and swap the hoagie rolls for whole wheat buns.",
