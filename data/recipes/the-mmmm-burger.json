This burger won the top prize in the Art of the Burger social media contest, so it’s one you won’t want to miss! “Mmmm” stands for “Maple Miso Mozza Mushroom”; in other words, all the good stuff. Recruit some little chefs to help prep the toppings and you’ll all be saying “mmmm” in no time. Congratulations, Darcie!",
