  "description": "It’s fall so, naturally, pumpkin spice is impossible to escape from. But, quite frankly, when there are recipes this good, why would you want to?! Pumpkin Cheesecake Mix has all the sugar, spice, and everything nice that you need to bring autumn to your Sheet Pan, with a sweet surprise in the middle. These cookies are a labour of love but so, so worth it. Be sure to let them cool completely in the pan after baking—they're delicate when they’re warm.",

    "In a large bowl, using a stand mixer (with paddle attachment) or hand mixer, beat cream cheese and 1 tbsp mix on medium-high until sugar in mix has dissolved. Using 1 heaping tsp as a guide, scoop cheesecake mixture into 16 portions and arrange on pan. Freeze until very firm, at least 20 min.",
    "Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350° F. Position the oven rack in the middle of the oven. Line two Sheet Pans with Sheet Pan Liners.",
    "Reserve 3 tbsp mix in a small bowl or on a plate; set aside. You will roll the cookies in it later.",
    "Spread pumpkin purée over a small plate. Using paper towels, press down on the purée to remove excess moisture. You should have about half the amount of purée left once you've removed most of the moisture. (You may need a few pieces of paper towel to do this.)",
    "In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.",
    "In a large bowl, using a stand mixer (with paddle attachment) or hand mixer, beat butter and remaining mix. Add egg yolks; beat on medium speed until batter is fluffy. Beat in dried pumpkin purée until combined. Gradually add in dry ingredients; combine on low speed.",
    "Using 2 tbsp as a guide, roll dough into 16 balls. Use your thumb to form a deep indent in the centre of each ball. Place a frozen cheesecake ball in each indentation. Wrap the dough around the ball until no cheesecake shows and then reroll into a smooth ball.",
    "Roll cookie balls in reserved mix.",
    "Arrange cookie balls on pan at least 2\" apart. Bake one pan at a time for 13 min, or until golden brown. Using a spatula or the bottom of a glass, gently press down on the warm cookies to flatten slightly. Cool 10 min on pan, then carefully transfer to Cooling Racks to cool completely."
