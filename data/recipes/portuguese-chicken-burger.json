  "description": "This is like Nando’s iconic Peri-Peri® burger but it’s even better because you made it yourself! Let’s face it, home cooking trumps takeout. We’ve dialed the heat to a perfect medium but added a creamy blend of mayo and sour cream to tame it. Insider tip: if time allows (even just 10 minutes), let the chicken marinate in the seasoning to soak up all that flavour. With a toasted bun, a nice char on the chicken, and your favourite fixings, boom, it’s burger bliss!",
