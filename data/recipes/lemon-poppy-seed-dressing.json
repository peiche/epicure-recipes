  "description": "Kick boring salads to the curb—and add a burst of lemon to brighten every bite! This dressing is light, sweet, and lemony, with a hint of onion. And, guess what? It's dairy free and gluten free, and you don't even need to buy lemons or poppy seeds—they’re both already in the blend! The longer the prepared dressing sits, the more lemony the flavour becomes, which is why it’s one of our faves for meal prep.",
