    "Queso fresco is a Mexican cheese with a slightly tangy and salty flavour. It’s used in many Latin American and South American dishes, from tacos and enchiladas to Colombian arepas. Because queso fresco doesn’t melt, it’s best used as finishing cheese – a great addition to salads, top burgers or grilled corn. Can’t find it at the grocery store? Swap in feta, ricotta or goat cheese."
