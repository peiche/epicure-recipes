  "description": "Your fave take-out meal just got better: now you can make it at home with simple ingredients. It’s got big flavour with that perfect sweet ‘n sour kick and a hint of ginger and chili (it’s not spicy—this is 100% kid-approved)! It’s got half the sugar and sodium of take-out, and it’s the ultimate stir-fry dinner for those busy nights. Leftovers? It reheats like a champ for tomorrow’s lunch. Get wok-ing!",
