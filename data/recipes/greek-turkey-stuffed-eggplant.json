    "Preheat oven to 400° F.",
    "Slice eggplants in half lengthwise. Cut around the insides of each half. Score flesh in a diamond pattern, being careful not to pierce the skin. Use a spoon to scoop out flesh, leaving each half with a 1&frasl;4\" thick shell. Chop eggplant centres into small pieces; set aside.",
    "Place eggplant shells in Multipurpose Steamer. It’s OK if they overlap. Cover; microwave on high for 2–4 min, or until softened. Set aside.",
    "Meanwhile, in a large oven-proof skillet, heat oil over medium-high. Crumble in turkey and add dressing mix. Stir often, breaking up large chunks as needed, until cooked through, 3–4 min. Add eggplant centres and tomato sauce. Cook, stirring often until softened, 2–3 min.",
    "Remove eggplant shells from steamer; scrape filing mixture into steamer. Place shells in the skillet (don’t wash). Generously fill shells with mixture; press in to pack down. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake until cheese melts, about 3 min. Serve and add toppings, if desired."
