  "description": "This cheesecake is creamy, sweet & light. A full proof recipe that’s egg free and oven free, with only 5 ingredients!  It’s a delightfully refreshing and airy dessert, that will keep you and your kitchen cool this summer. If a whole cake is too much, spoon filling into pre-baked mini tart or phyllo shells and freeze what you don’t need for another day. Switch things up and swap raspberries for your choice of local, in-season berries.",
