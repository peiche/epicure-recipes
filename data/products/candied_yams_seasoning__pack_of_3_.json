  "name": "Candied Yams Seasoning (Pack of 3)",
  "summary": [
    "Take candied yams beyond the Thanksgiving table and whip them up anytime you’re looking for a side dish that brings the flavor! This blend pairs cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg with orange peel to create a perfectly sweet glaze for yams or sweet potatoes. We love them paired with turkey or ham – and during hectic holiday cooking, it’s a relief to have a side dish that doesn’t hog the oven. Use your Round or Multipurpose Steamer to make them in just 15 minutes in the microwave–game-changer!&nbsp;"
