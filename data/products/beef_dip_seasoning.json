    "A gastro-pub fave, it’s now easy – and so darn tasty – to make Beef Dip at home. With soft, subtle notes of mushrooms, garlic, rosemary, and thyme, stack this melt-in-your-mouth beef on top of crusty baguettes topped with Roasted Garlic Aioli and serve on busy weeknights and weekends at home, or feed a crowd on game day.&nbsp;"
