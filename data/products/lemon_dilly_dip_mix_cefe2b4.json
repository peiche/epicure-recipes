  "summary": [
    "Beyond being one of our most-loved kid-friendly dips – they love it for dunking chicken strips, fish bites, and veggies – Lemon Dilly is all about versatility. With loads of dill and a hint of lemon zest, it makes an utterly delicious tzatziki and spread for burgers and sandwiches, and levels up everything from salad dressing and salmon to pasta and vegetables.&nbsp;&nbsp;"
