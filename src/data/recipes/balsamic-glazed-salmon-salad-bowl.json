{"name":"Balsamic Glazed Salmon Salad Bowl","slug":"balsamic-glazed-salmon-salad-bowl","description":"Salmon is a powerhouse of Omega-3 fatty acids, which are awesome for heart health and brain function! Make it a weekly catch to reel in those health benefits. The salmon is glazed with a sauce that’s both zesty and sweet. As for veggies? The more, the merrier! Use your favourites or what’s available in the fridge. Goat cheese adds a creamy richness for a delightful twist, but feel free to swap with feta, or a shredded cheese of your choice.","ingredients":[{"name":"balsamic vinegar","quantity":"<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup + 2 tsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"honey","quantity":"2 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Dijon mustard","quantity":"1 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing Mix or Greek Dressing Mix","quantity":"1  tbsp","additionalInstruction":"divided"},{"name":"salmon fillet","quantity":"1 lb (450 g)","additionalInstruction":"about 1” thick"},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"1 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"goat cheese crumbles","quantity":"<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"mixed greens","quantity":"8 cups","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"cherry tomatoes","quantity":"1 pint","additionalInstruction":null}],"totalTime":"20 min","servings":"4 servings","preparation":["Preheat oven to 400° F.","Meanwhile, prepare sauce.
