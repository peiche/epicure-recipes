Stir in both mixes and 4 cups grated carrot. Divide batter between pans; smooth top. Bake for 35–40 min or until a toothpick inserted in centre comes out clean. Cool 10 min; unmold onto Cooling Racks.","Let cakes cool completely while preparing icing. You can place them in the fridge to speed up the process. In a bowl, using an electric mixer, beat cream cheese with butter until smooth. Beat in vanilla. Beat in icing sugar, 1&frasl;2 cup at a time, until smooth.","To assemble, place one cake in the center of another Sheet Pan or rectangular serving platter. This will be the face.","Place the other cake on your work surface; this will be the ears and bow tie. Using a knife, cut two matching ovals from each side of the cake to make the ears. The centre of the cake (what’s left after you’ve cut out the ears) will be the bow tie. You can use a mixing bowl to help with the curve of the ears.","Arrange the ears above the face and the bow tie below.
