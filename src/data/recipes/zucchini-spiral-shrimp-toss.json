{"name":"Zucchini Spiral Shrimp Toss","slug":"zucchini-spiral-shrimp-toss","description":"Zucchini noodles are the best way to enjoy a big ol’ bowl of pasta while getting a full serving of veggies, great for our low-carb and keto friends. Their mild flavour and tender texture make them a great dupe for regular pasta noodles. If you don’t have a spiralizer, you can pick up bags of frozen zucchini spirals at the grocery store and reheat in the microwave in Multipurpose Steamer. This versatile dish also works with tofu or cooked chicken instead of shrimp.","ingredients":[{"name":"zucchini","quantity":"4 ","additionalInstruction":"cut into 3\" long rounds"},{"name":"Marinara Sauce","quantity":"3 cups","additionalInstruction":"prepared"},{"name":"diced tomatoes","quantity":"1 can (28 oz/796 ml)","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"crushed tomatoes","quantity":"1 can (28 oz/796 ml)","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Marinara Sauce Mix","quantity":"3 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"peeled and deveined shrimp","quantity":"1 lb (450 g)","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"grated Parmesan","quantity":"<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup","additionalInstruction":"optional"}],"totalTime":"20 min","servings":"4 servings","preparation":["Using a vegetable spiralizer, form zucchini into thin noodles.
