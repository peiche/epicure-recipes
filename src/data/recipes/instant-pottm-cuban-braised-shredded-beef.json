{"name":"Instant Pot™ Cuban Braised Shredded Beef","slug":"instant-pottm-cuban-braised-shredded-beef","description":"Inspired by a Cuban favourite Ropa Vieja, the name translates as “old rags” as the shreds of crumpled beef resemble them. The classic recipe is a saucy mix of meat, sweet bell peppers, onion and tangy olives. It’s typically made with flank steak, but we love how pot roast guarantees tender, flavourful juicy shreds. We also love the time-saving, hands-off Instant Pot™ approach versus simmering away for hours on the stovetop. This dish is very rich – so a little goes a long way! For a traditional presentation, serve with rice and black beans.","ingredients":[{"name":"diced tomatoes","quantity":"1 can (14 oz/398 ml)","additionalInstruction":"preferably fire-roasted"},{"name":"white wine or low-sodium beef broth","quantity":"<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"bay leaves","quantity":"2","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Fajita Seasoning or Taco Seasoning","quantity":"2 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Italian Seasoning","quantity":"2 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Smoked Spanish Paprika","quantity":"1 tsp","additionalInstruction":"optional"},{"name":"salt","quantity":"1 tsp","additionalInstruction":"optional"},{"name":"pot roast","quantity":"3 lbs (1.3 kg)","additionalInstruction":"such as boneless blade chuck roast"},{"name":"onion","quantity":"1","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"large bell peppers","quantity":"2","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"pimento-stuffed green olives","quantity":"<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup","additionalInstruction":"about 6-8"}],"totalTime":"70 min","servings":"12 servings","preparation":["In an 8 Quart Instant Pot™, stir together tomatoes, wine or broth, bay leaves, Fajita or Taco Seasoning, Italian Seasoning and Smoked Paprika and salt, if using.","Cut roast in half and place in pot.
