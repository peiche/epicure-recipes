{"name":"Tomato Soup","slug":"tomato-soup","description":"Forget the canned stuff—once you get a taste of this homemade version and see how easy it is to whip up, you’ll never go back. It’s allergen free, with no gluten, soy, or dairy (unless you want to swirl in some cream). And, it’s got half the sugar and one-third the sodium of the canned stuff. Remember, it’s not the full tomato soup experience without a grilled cheese on the side.","ingredients":[{"name":"Tomato Soup Seasoning","quantity":"1 pkg","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"tomato paste","quantity":"1 can (6 oz/156 ml)","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"water","quantity":"4 cups","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"heavy cream","quantity":"2 tbsp","additionalInstruction":"optional"}],"totalTime":"20 min","servings":"4 servings","preparation":["In a medium pot, whisk seasoning with tomato paste and water.
