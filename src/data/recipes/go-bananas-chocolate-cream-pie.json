The bag will have a triangle shape. Place into a tall glass (this makes it easier to fill) and fold edge over. Spoon in whipped cream and roll up overhanging edge. Squeeze out any excess air and twist the bag to seal. Snip the bottom tip of the bag to allow the whipped cream to flow freely."],"perfectlyBalanceYourPlate":"","imagePath":"../images/go_bananas_chocolate_cream_pie_1036x583.jpg","products":[{"slug":"chocolate_instant_pudding_mix__pack_of_3___caldic__bc2ef56","name":"Chocolate Instant Pudding Mix (Pack of 2)"}]}
