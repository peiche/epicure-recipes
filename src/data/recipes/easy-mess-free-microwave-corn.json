Serve with warm butter, and a sprinkling of your favourite seasoning (we love Cheesy Fries or Cajun Fries Seasoning) and you’ll be able to enjoy corn on the cobb, all summerlong. Thank you, Dana Kayal, for this amazing hack!","ingredients":[{"name":"small corn cobs","quantity":"4 ","additionalInstruction":"unshucked"}],"totalTime":"10 min","servings":"4 servings","preparation":["Cut off and discard stem ends from corn.
