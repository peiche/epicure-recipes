{"name":"Portuguese Chicken Burger","slug":"portuguese-chicken-burger","description":"This is like Nando’s iconic Peri-Peri® burger but it’s even better because you made it yourself!

Insider tip: if time allows (even just 10 minutes), let the chicken marinate in the seasoning to soak up all that flavour. With a toasted bun, a nice char on the chicken, and your favourite fixings, boom, it’s burger bliss!","ingredients":[{"name":"boneless, skinless chicken thighs","quantity":"2 lbs (900 g)","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Portuguese Chicken Seasoning or Rotisserie Chicken Seasoning","quantity":"1 pkg","additionalInstruction":"divided"},{"name":"lime juice and oil","quantity":"2 tbsp each","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"light mayonnaise and sour cream","quantity":"<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup each","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"burger buns","quantity":"8","additionalInstruction":null}],"totalTime":"15 min","servings":"8 servings","preparation":["Preheat grill to medium-high heat.
