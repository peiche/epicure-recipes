Gradually beat in flour until just mixed.","Remove half the dough and set aside. Sprinkle cocoa powder over remaining half. Gently beat (if using a paddle attachment), or knead until evenly mixed.","Divide each half into 2 pieces to make 2 chocolate and 2 vanilla halves. Between sheets of parchment paper, flatten each piece into a large rectangle, approximately 9 1&frasl;2” in length. Remove the top piece of parchment from each and invert the chocolate rectangles over the vanilla. Gently press together, and remove the top piece of parchment from the chocolate.","Starting at the long end, tightly roll each stack into logs, peeling the dough from the bottom parchment as you go. Wrap each log in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour, until well chilled (or freeze up to 2 months).","When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350° F (175° C).
