{"name":"Chickpea Kale Soup","slug":"chickpea-kale-soup","description":"Think homemade soup is complicated? Uh-uh! It’s as simple as mixing frozen veggies and a can of beans, then bolstering flavour with a flavourful broth. Frozen veggies are healthy and convenient. They’re frozen soon after picking, which helps lock in nutrients. Streamline cooking with  Steamers. These make meals easy: mix, cook, serve and even store leftovers in them.","ingredients":[{"name":"Vegetable Broth","quantity":"6 cups","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Vegetable Broth Mix","quantity":"1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"boiling water","quantity":"1 cup","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"mixed vegetables","quantity":"3 cups","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"shredded kale or spinach","quantity":"3 cups","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"chickpeas","quantity":"1 can (14 oz /398 ml)","additionalInstruction":" rinsed"},{"name":"Fajita Seasoning or Greek Dressing Mix","quantity":"2 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Sea Salt","quantity":null,"additionalInstruction":"to taste"},{"name":"Black Pepper","quantity":null,"additionalInstruction":"to taste"}],"totalTime":"17 min","servings":"8 cups","preparation":["Combine ingredients in a Multipurpose Steamer.","Microwave with lid on for 10–12 minutes, until vegetables are soft.","Very carefully remove from microwave, season to taste, stir, and serve.","Combine ingredients in a Multipurpose Pot and bring to a boil.","Reduce heat and simmer for 10–15 minutes, until vegetables are soft."],"tags":[{"slug":"steamers","name":"Steamers"},{"slug":"vegan","name":"Vegan"},{"slug":"one_dish","name":"One Dish"},{"slug":"microwave","name":"Microwave"},{"slug":"dinner","name":"Dinner"},{"slug":"vegetarian","name":"Vegetarian"},{"slug":"gluten_free_e8446d0","name":"Gluten-free"},{"slug":"sides","name":"Side Dishes"},{"slug":"dairy_free","name":"Dairy-free"},{"slug":"sugar_conscious","name":"Sugar Conscious"},{"slug":"lunch","name":"Lunch"},{"slug":"stovetop_978bc23","name":"Stovetop"}],"nutritionalInformation":{"servingSize":"2 cups","calories":270,"fat":2.5,"saturatedFat":-2.5,"transFat":0,"cholesterol":0,"sodium":550,"carbohydrate":53,"fiber":13,"sugars":2,"protein":13},"tips":["Bump up protein and stir in cooked shredded chicken, frozen shrimp or shelled edamame."],"perfectlyBalanceYourPlate":"Serve with 1 tbsp feta cheese and a crusty whole wheat roll.","imagePath":"../images/Chickpea-Kale-Soup-Main.jpg","products":[{"slug":"fajita_seasoning_ceb100c","name":"Fajita Seasoning"},{"slug":"greek_dressing_mix_d75eccd","name":"Greek Dressing Mix"},{"slug":"multipurpose_steamer_bd092c3","name":"Multipurpose Steamer"}]}
