{"name":"Clean-Out-The-Fridge Pulled Pork Stew ","slug":"clean-out-the-fridge-pulled-pork-stew","description":"This is the ultimate, end-of-the-week dinner. Soups are a great way to use up all the odds and ends left over in your fridge. Save time by cooking Steamer Rice ahead of time so you can just stir it right into your soup at the end of cooking, no extra simmering required. Pulled pork adds delicious smokiness, but you can swap it for chickpeas, lentils, beans, or Rotisserie Chicken.
