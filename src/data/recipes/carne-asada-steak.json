{"name":" \nCarne Asada Steak","slug":"carne-asada-steak","description":"Carne Asada is Mexican-style grilled steak that has been marinated with the robust flavours of cumin, chipotle peppers, and a whole lotta citrus. These flavours taste even better with a hot char from the grill, so fire it up! Thinly slice and then wrap steak slices in tacos or burritos, make sandwiches in crusty buns with Roasted Garlic Aioli, or lay slices across a bed of spinach with creamy Caesar Dressing. Our Carne Asada Marinade Mix is a hot, fiery blend, so kiddos may want to tame the heat with Guacamole or Greek yogurt.","ingredients":[{"name":"lean flank or skirt steak ","quantity":"1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>–2 lbs (675–900 g)","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"orange juice","quantity":"3 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Carne Asada Marinade Mix","quantity":"2 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"lime juice","quantity":"2 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"oil + more for brushing","quantity":"1 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null}],"totalTime":"1 hr 20 mins (includes 1 hour marination)","servings":"8 servings","preparation":["In Multipurpose Steamer, combine orange juice, mix, lime juice, and oil.","Add steak to steamer; flip to coat.
