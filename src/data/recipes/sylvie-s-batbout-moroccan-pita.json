Set aside the mixture until it's frothy, about 5–10 minutes.","Blend the flours, seasoning , remaining sugar and sea salt in a mixing bowl. Add the yeast mixture, oil, and remaining water, and mix to form a dough.","The dough should be soft but not sticky. If it's too sticky to work with, add a little flour, 1 tbsp at a time. (Remember the dough will absorb a bit more flour if you knead it by hand.) If the dough feels a bit stiff, work in additional water, 1 tbsp at a time.","Knead the dough in a mixer with a dough hook, or by hand on a lightly floured surface, about 10 minutes or until smooth and elastic.","Divide the dough into smooth balls and leave them to rest, covered, on a lightly floured surface for about 10 minutes.","Roll out each ball into a thin circle, about 1&frasl;8” thick. Set the rolled-out dough on a clean, dry towel and cover. Leave to rise for about 1–1 1&frasl;2 hours.","Preheat a very lightly oiled cast iron skillet or non-stick pan over medium heat. Cook the Batbout, turning several times, until golden-brown on both sides. The browning will be a bit uneven since the bread puffs up as it cooks, and that's okay.","Transfer the cooked Batbout to a cooling rack to cool. It's okay to stack them while they're warm."],"tags":[{"slug":"sides","name":"Side Dishes"},{"slug":"vegetarian","name":"Vegetarian"},{"slug":"appetizers___small_bites","name":"Appetizers & Small Bites"},{"slug":"dinner","name":"Dinner"},{"slug":"lunch","name":"Lunch"},{"slug":"vegan","name":"Vegan"},{"slug":"onion_free","name":"Onion-free"},{"slug":"sugar_conscious","name":"Sugar Conscious"},{"slug":"dairy_free","name":"Dairy-free"},{"slug":"garlic_free","name":"Garlic-free"}],"nutritionalInformation":{"servingSize":"","calories":200,"fat":3,"saturatedFat":0.3,"transFat":0,"cholesterol":0,"sodium":280,"carbohydrate":37,"fiber":3,"sugars":2,"protein":6},"tips":["Batbout will keep fresh for two days at room temperature.
