{"name":"Grilled Flank Steak","slug":"grilled-flank-steak","description":"Life can be tough, but your steak doesn’t have to be. Marinating locks in moisture and flavour and tenderizes the meat, so by the time it hits the grill, the work is already done! For lean cuts of beef like this one, it’s best to let it marinate for a minimum of 2 hours, but the longer the better to achieve a juicier steak. Lean cuts are a good source of protein, iron, zinc and Vitamin B12.","ingredients":[{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"low-sodium soy sauce","quantity":"<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Montreal Steak Rub or Beef & Steak Seasoning","quantity":"2 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"lime or lemon juice","quantity":"2 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"light brown sugar","quantity":"2 tbsp","additionalInstruction":"lightly packed"},{"name":"flank steak","quantity":"2 lbs (900 g)","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Sea Salt & Black Pepper","quantity":null,"additionalInstruction":"to taste"}],"totalTime":"50 min (includes 30 min marinating)","servings":"8 servings","preparation":["In Multipurpose or Round Steamer, whisk olive oil, soy sauce, steak rub, lime juice, and brown sugar.
