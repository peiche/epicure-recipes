{"name":"Roast Chicken Bone Broth","slug":"roast-chicken-bone-broth","description":"Bone broth is a nourishing food filled with nutrients and comforting flavour. The most important ingredients are roasted bones – a great way to use leftover roast chicken carcass. Slow cooking extracts all the nutrients (most notably, collagen) and proteins so they seep into the broth. Collagen supports good skin, hair and nail health. We love using an Instant Pot(tm) because it contains all the “aromas” and is faster than stovetop cooking.","ingredients":[{"name":"Rotisserie Chickens","quantity":"2","additionalInstruction":"leftover bones only"},{"name":"whole chicken","quantity":"3 lbs (1.36 kg)","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Rotisserie Chicken Seasoning","quantity":"1 pkg","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"cold water","quantity":"8-10 cups","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"apple cider vinegar","quantity":"3 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Vegetable scraps","quantity":null,"additionalInstruction":"optional"},{"name":"Sea salt","quantity":null,"additionalInstruction":"to taste"}],"totalTime":"3 hours","servings":"8","preparation":["In an 8-quart programmable pressure cooker, place chicken bones, vinegar, and veggies, if using.
