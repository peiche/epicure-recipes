Line Sheet Pan with Sheet Pan Liner.","Using a stand mixer (with paddle attachment) or hand mixer, on medium speed, beat mix with butter and water for 2–3 min or until a soft, uniform dough forms.","Scoop or roll dough into 15 balls, about one heaping tbsp each. Arrange on pan, spacing 1\" apart. Using your thumb or the back of a small spoon, press down to make a small indent in the centre of each ball. To help them keep their shape, hold the sides of the cookie, and press any cracks that form on the edges back into place. Fill each indent with jam, about 1 tsp per cookie.","Bake 14–16 min or until edges are light golden. Let cool on pan 5 min.","Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk together sugar, 2 tsp milk, and vanilla extract. If needed to reach the desired consistency, add more milk, 1&frasl;2 tsp at a time.  Using a piping bag with small nozzle, pipe in a zig zag pattern over cookies while they are still warm. Let glaze set and cookies cool completely before serving."],"tags":[{"slug":"dessert","name":"Dessert"},{"slug":"low_sodium","name":"Low-sodium"},{"slug":"easter","name":"Easter"},{"slug":"birthday","name":"Birthday"},{"slug":"sugar_conscious","name":"Sugar Conscious"},{"slug":"valentine_s_day","name":"Valentine’s Day"},{"slug":"mother_s_day","name":"Mother’s Day"},{"slug":"vegetarian","name":"Vegetarian"},{"slug":"gluten_free_e8446d0","name":"Gluten-free"},{"slug":"sheet_pan_3e5bebd","name":"Sheet Pan"},{"slug":"epic_life_desserts","name":"Desserts"},{"slug":"better_than_take_out","name":"Better Than Takeout"},{"slug":"new_year_s_eve","name":"New Year’s Eve"},{"slug":"christmas","name":"Christmas"}],"nutritionalInformation":{"servingSize":"1 cookie","calories":140,"fat":7,"saturatedFat":4,"transFat":0.3,"cholesterol":15,"sodium":35,"carbohydrate":20,"fiber":1,"sugars":11,"protein":1},"tips":["Don’t have a piping bag?
