{"name":"Chicken Barbacoa","slug":"chicken-barbacoa","description":"Barbacoa is a classic, crave-worthy, shredded taco filling. Slow cooking tenderizes the meat while absorbing all those big, bold flaves of ancho and smoky chipotle peppers, garlic, and oregano. The heat sits at medium, so it’s still family-friendly. You can always “cool it” with a dollop of creamy Guacamole.","ingredients":[{"name":"Chicken Barbacoa Seasoning","quantity":"1 pkg","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"water","quantity":"<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>–1 cup","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"oil","quantity":"2 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"tomato paste","quantity":"1 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"boneless, skinless chicken","quantity":"3 lbs (1.5 kg)","additionalInstruction":null}],"totalTime":"35 min","servings":"12 servings","preparation":["In a slow cooker, combine seasoning with 1&frasl;2 cup water, oil, and tomato paste.
