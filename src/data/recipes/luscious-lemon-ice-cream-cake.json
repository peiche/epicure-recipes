{"name":"Luscious Lemon Ice Cream Cake","slug":"luscious-lemon-ice-cream-cake","description":"Lemon curd is pudding’s sweet & zesty sister. Its silky texture adds a tangy layer in ice cream cakes. We love this with vanilla ice cream, but it’s also dynamite with chocolate or strawberry. Streamline prep—make the Luscious Lemon Curd the day before assembling the cake. This way it will be chilled and ready to use! This cake is perfect for summer celebrations.","ingredients":[{"name":"Luscious Lemon Curd","quantity":"1 recipe prepared","additionalInstruction":"divided"},{"name":"eggs","quantity":"3","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Luscious Lemon Curd Mix","quantity":"1 pkg","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"water","quantity":"<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"butter","quantity":"1 tbsp","additionalInstruction":"optional"},{"name":"fresh or frozen blueberries","quantity":"1 cup","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt","quantity":"2 containers (1.65 L each)","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"whipping cream","quantity":"2 cups","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"icing sugar","quantity":"1 cup","additionalInstruction":null}],"totalTime":"7 hrs (includes 6 hrs freeze time)","servings":"16 servings","preparation":["Set 1 container ice cream on the counter to soften.","Line Round Steamer with plastic wrap—you’ll need 2 large pieces so it covers the bottom and comes up and over the side.","Measure out 2 tbsp lemon curd.

Sprinkle blueberries on top into an even layer. Freeze for 2 hrs or until firm.","Meanwhile, set second ice cream container out on the counter to soften. Once the first layer is firm, spoon remaining ice cream on top; spread into an even layer. Loosely cover with the overhanging plastic wrap. Gently tap steamer on counter a few times to help pack the layers. Freeze until very firm, at least 5 hrs or overnight.","For the topping, pour cream into a chilled bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat just until soft peaks start to form. Gradually beat in icing sugar until stiff peaks form when beaters are lifted. Gently fold in reserved lemon curd.","To decorate the cake, remove steamer from freezer and unwrap plastic; let the plastic wrap overhang on the outside of the steamer. Place a large plate on top of the steamer; carefully invert cake onto plate. Remove and discard plastic wrap.","Spread whipped cream all over top and sides of cake. If you wish, save some of the whipped cream and put in a piping bag; pipe a border around top of cake. Add additional toppings, if desired.
