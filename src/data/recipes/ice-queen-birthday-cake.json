Scoop into steamer; using the 3-in-1 Spatula, spread into an even layer. Top with chilled chocolate sauce. Freeze for 1 hr or until firm.","Meanwhile, set the chocolate ice cream out on the counter to soften. Once the vanilla layer is firm, spoon chocolate ice cream on top; spread into an even layer. Loosely cover with the overhanging plastic wrap. Gently tap steamer on counter a few times to help pack the layers. Freeze until very firm, at least 5 hrs or overnight.","For the topping, pour cream into a chilled bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat just until soft peaks start to form. Gradually beat in icing sugar, then vanilla, until stiff peaks form when beaters are lifted.","To decorate the cake, remove steamer from freezer and unwrap plastic; let the plastic wrap overhang on the outside of the steamer. Place a large plate on top of the steamer; carefully invert cake onto plate. Remove and discard plastic wrap.","Spread whipped cream all over top and sides of cake. If you wish, save some of the whipped cream and put in a piping bag; pipe a border around top of cake. Generously shake on topper.
