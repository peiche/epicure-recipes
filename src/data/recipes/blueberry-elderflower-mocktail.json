It's much smoother tasting because the cooler temperature slowly extracts flavour over several hours, which helps prevent a bitter or astringent taste. Place 1–2 tea bags per cup of cold water in a sealed container. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight. Use within 4 days of brewing.","Looking for a tangy, zesty zing?
