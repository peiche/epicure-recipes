{"name":"Power Up Chocolate Protein Brownies","slug":"power-up-chocolate-protein-brownies","description":"Power up with these epic brownies when you need to satisfy a craving! They’re vegan; low sugar; and egg, gluten, and peanut free, so they’ll work for almost everyone. And, they’re packed with 4 grams of protein, so you’re getting the most out of your sweets—protein slows the absorption of glucose to help you avoid a sugar spike (and crash!). Serve with a dollop of prepared Summer Berry Sweet Dip for a little extra sweetness.","ingredients":[{"name":"ripe bananas","quantity":"6","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"almond butter","quantity":"1 cup","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"cocoa powder","quantity":"<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Power Up Chocolate Protein Blend or Power Up Salted Caramel Protein or Power Up Vanilla Caramel Protein","quantity":"2 scoops","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"chocolate chips","quantity":"1 cup","additionalInstruction":"optional"}],"totalTime":"38 min","servings":"25 servings","preparation":["Preheat oven to 350˚ F.
