{"name":"Cheesy Ratatouille Clouds ","slug":"cheesy-ratatouille-clouds","description":"Our favourite little chef, Remy the rat, will be blown away by this presentation. Cottage cheese is whipped until it’s as airy as a cloud and then topped with Ratatouille. This recipe is a fun and elegant (and, not to mention, protein-packed) way to serve a classic, French, veggie dish when entertaining guests.  To save time, prep Ratatouille ahead of time—when it’s time to dish it up, simply re-heat it on the stovetop or in the microwave.","ingredients":[{"name":"eggplant ","quantity":"1","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"red bell pepper","quantity":"1","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"zucchini","quantity":"1","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"olive oil","quantity":"2 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Ratatouille Seasoning or Chicken Souvlaki Seasoning ","quantity":"1 pkg","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"diced tomatoes","quantity":"1 can (14 oz/398 ml)","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"lemon","quantity":"<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"2% cottage cheese","quantity":"2 cups","additionalInstruction":null}],"totalTime":"20 min","servings":"6 servings","preparation":["Dice eggplant, pepper, and zucchini.","Heat oil in Sauté Pan over medium heat.
