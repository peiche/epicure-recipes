{"name":"Fettuccine Alfredo","slug":"fettuccine-alfredo","description":"Excuse us, while we polish the crown that sits on top of Alfredo Sauce. This sauce is a #1 classic for its rich, creamy, and oh-so-satisfying taste. Fettuccine's thick shape brings the maximum amount of creamy sauce with every bite. This Alfredo clocks in at 280 calories per portion! It absolutely does not taste like “skinny” Alfredo! It’s velvety and smooth with no starchy aftertaste. Gluten free? No problem! Our sauce is GF, just choose your noodle accordingly.","ingredients":[{"name":"Alfredo Sauce Mix","quantity":"1 pkg","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"milk","quantity":"1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups","additionalInstruction":"your choice"},{"name":"cooked pasta","quantity":"6 cups","additionalInstruction":"your choice"}],"totalTime":"10 min","servings":"6 servings","preparation":["In a large Multipurpose Pot, combine sauce mix with milk.","Whisking constantly, bring to a boil over medium-high; reduce heat and simmer 3 min or until thickened.","Combine prepared sauce with your choice of cooked pasta.","In a 4-cup microwaveable bowl or Multipurpose Steamer, combine mix with milk.
