It’s used in many Latin American and South American dishes, from tacos and enchiladas to Colombian arepas. Because queso fresco doesn’t melt, it’s best used as finishing cheese – a great addition to salads, top burgers or grilled corn. Can’t find it at the grocery store? Swap in feta, ricotta or goat cheese."],"perfectlyBalanceYourPlate":"","imagePath":"../images/star_spangled_layer_dip_1036x583.jpg"}
