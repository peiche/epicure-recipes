Cover potatoes with water, then bring to a boil. Simmer until fork tender.","Drain potatoes. When cool enough to handle, peel potatoes, then chop into smaller pieces. Pass potatoes through a ricer or food mill (this will give the dough a smooth, uniform texture rather than just mashing). Taste and season with Sea Salt.","Place cool mashed potatoes onto a counter lightly dusted with flour. Form into a mound and create a hollow in the centre. Pour in egg. Using a fork, mix in.","Mix flour with potato starch. Add flour mixture, a little at a time to form a dough. At some point start to work the dough with your hands, kneading gently. Dough should feel elastic and moist, but not sticky.","Working with floured hands, place dough on a large cutting board dusted with more flour. Divide dough into small balls, then roll to form a rope about the width of your index finger. Slice into pieces (about 3&frasl;4–1-inch).","Using your finger, make indents in centre of each piece of dough to form a pillow (good for catching sauce). Or using the tines of a fork, roll dough pieces over tines to create ridges.","As gnocchi are made, place on Sheet Pan lined with Sheet Pan Liner or parchment paper. Freeze gnocchi in a single layer, then portion into a freezer bag for easier storage.","To cook, bring water or Broth to a boil in a pasta pot. Carefully drop in fresh or frozen gnocchi, a few at a time. As soon as they float on the surface, remove with a slotted spoon. Arrange in a warm serving dish and drizzle with your favourite sauce.","Whisk olive oil with Herb & Garlic Dip Mix. Warm in the microwave, then drizzle over gnocchi. Finish with grated parmesan cheese, if you wish."],"tags":[{"slug":"vegetarian","name":"Vegetarian"},{"slug":"dairy_free","name":"Dairy-free"},{"slug":"one_dish","name":"One Dish"},{"slug":"dinner","name":"Dinner"},{"slug":"lunch","name":"Lunch"},{"slug":"low_sodium","name":"Low-sodium"},{"slug":"gluten_free_e8446d0","name":"Gluten-free"},{"slug":"sugar_conscious","name":"Sugar Conscious"}],"nutritionalInformation":{"servingSize":"","calories":280,"fat":10,"saturatedFat":1.5,"transFat":0,"cholesterol":20,"sodium":45,"carbohydrate":43,"fiber":3,"sugars":1,"protein":6},"tips":["The secret to light and fluffy gnocchi is to use old potatoes – they have less moisture, which makes superior dough.
