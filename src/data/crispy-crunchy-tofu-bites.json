Place heavy items—cutting board, cookbooks, or bowls—on top&nbsp;to weigh down tofu and remove extra liquid. Let sit 20 min. Alternatively, look for already pressed tofu (it will be vacuumed packed, with no liquid in it) at the grocery store.&nbsp;It’ll give your nuggets an irresistible texture.</p>"}
