Bring to a boil over high heat, whisking often. Reduce heat to medium; simmer and whisk frequently for 3–4 min.&nbsp;Cool completely (refrigerate to speed up time). If making ahead, cover and refrigerate up to 3 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Place cream cheese in a bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat on high until smooth, scraping down sides occasionally. Add cold caramel sauce and salt; beat until light and fluffy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>To assemble, spread a spoonful of icing in&nbsp;centre&nbsp;of a cake plate&nbsp;or&nbsp;pedestal. Place cake on top. Spread half the icing over top of the cake. Gently place remaining cake on top. Spread remaining icing over top of cake,&nbsp;just to the edges. There will be leftover icing—if you wish,&nbsp;you can ice the whole cake or freeze it for another day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>","tags":[{"slug":"gluten_free_e8446d0","name":"Gluten-free"},{"slug":"birthday","name":"Birthday"},{"slug":"mother_s_day","name":"Mother’s Day"},{"slug":"low_sodium","name":"Low-sodium"},{"slug":"dessert","name":"Dessert"},{"slug":"garlic_free","name":"Garlic-free"},{"slug":"onion_free","name":"Onion-free"},{"slug":"valentine_s_day","name":"Valentine’s Day"},{"slug":"sugar_conscious","name":"Sugar Conscious"}],"nutritionalInformation":{"servingSize":"1 slice","calories":320,"fat":21,"saturatedFat":8,"transFat":0.1,"cholesterol":35,"sodium":400,"carbohydrate":31,"fiber":1,"sugars":19,"protein":4},"tips":""}
