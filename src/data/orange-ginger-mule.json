It's much smoother because the cooler temperature slowly extracts flavour over several hours, which helps prevent a bitter or astringent taste, especially with caffeinated teas. Place 1â€“2 tea bags per cup of cold water in a sealed container. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight. Use within 4 days of brewing.</p>","perfectlyBalanceYourPlate":""}
