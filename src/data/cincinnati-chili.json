{"name":"Cincinnati Chili","slug":"cincinnati-chili","description":"<p>Thank you, Christine Naykki, who inspired and collaborated with us on this product! Cincinnati Chili is a meaty, saucy chili with warming spices like cumin and cinnamon. It’s kind of like a Bolognese, so it makes sense that it’s typically served over spaghetti. Serve it over hot dogs, too—game day, anyone? This makes a big batch (6 cups!) so it’s great for meal planning.</p>","ingredients":[{"name":"Cincinnati Chili Seasoning","quantity":"1 pkg","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"water","quantity":"4 cups","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"tomato paste","quantity":"1 can (6 oz/156 ml)","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"lean ground beef","quantity":"2 lbs (900 g)","additionalInstruction":null}],"totalTime":"1 hr 10 min","servings":"12 servings","preparation":"<ol>\n  <li>In a large pot over medium-high heat, combine seasoning with water and tomato paste.
