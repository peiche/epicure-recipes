{"slug":"candied_yams_seasoning__pack_of_3_","name":"Candied Yams Seasoning (Pack of 3)","summary":["Take candied yams beyond the Thanksgiving table and whip them up anytime you’re looking for a side dish that brings the flavor! This blend pairs cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg with orange peel to create a perfectly sweet glaze for yams or sweet potatoes. We love them paired with turkey or ham – and during hectic holiday cooking, it’s a relief to have a side dish that doesn’t hog the oven. Use your Round or Multipurpose Steamer to make them in just 15 minutes in the microwave–game-changer!&nbsp;"]}
