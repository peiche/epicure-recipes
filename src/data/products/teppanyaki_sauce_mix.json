{"slug":"teppanyaki_sauce_mix","name":"Teppanyaki Sauce Mix","summary":["With a garlic-ginger and sesame flavour, Teppanyaki is the ultimate combination of salty, sweet, and umami. Inspired by ever-popular Japanese steak sauce, we make ours healthier – it's free from xanthan gum, lactic acid, and potassium sorbate (and made without eggs) – so you can liberally drizzle it all over perfectly grilled meat and veggies. Just mix it with pantry staples and savour the flavour.&nbsp;&nbsp;"]}
