{"slug":"strawberry_margarita_mix","name":"Strawberry Margarita Mix","summary":["We can transport ourselves to the tropics whenever we want with our <strong>Strawberry Margarita Mix</strong>. With a sweet, tangy blend of real strawberries and tart lime juice, we can create restaurant-quality margaritas by blending with ice, strawberries (frozen or fresh), and water (tequila optional). This mix is also perfect for other fruity cocktails or mocktails. Made with high-quality, natural ingredients, it's a healthier alternative to traditional, sugary mixes.&nbsp;"]}
