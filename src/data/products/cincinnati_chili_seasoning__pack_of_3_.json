{"slug":"cincinnati_chili_seasoning__pack_of_3_","name":"Cincinnati Chili Seasoning (Pack of 3)","summary":["More of a meaty topping than a traditional stew, Cincinnati Chili is sweet, savoury, and subtly spicy and traditionally served piled on spaghetti with tons of toppings. This one is all about versatility and is served in different “ways.” Try it Two-Way with just the chili topping and spaghetti — this is the base. To make it Three-Way, add cheese, Four-Way, add onions, or Five-Way by adding kidney beans. Any <em>way</em>, it’s sure to be the talk of your next game day gathering or family get-together!&nbsp;&nbsp;"]}
