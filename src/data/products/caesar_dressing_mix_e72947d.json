{"slug":"caesar_dressing_mix_e72947d","name":"Caesar Dressing Mix","summary":["This dressing is a little bit of magic: It’s rich, creamy, full of flavor, and it has zero sodium! Take it far beyond Caesar salad and use it as a sauce for pizza, a dip for veggies, chicken fingers, and zucchini fries, or mix it in your white pasta sauce.&nbsp;Simply mix the blend with mayo or Greek yogurt, lemon juice, olive oil, and milk, and it’s ready for anything!&nbsp;&nbsp;"]}
