Yet, they give off that fancy, “I spent hours in the kitchen” vibe. And, they’re gluten free, low sodium, and kid friendly—all the good stuff. These meatballs are great for meal prep: freeze the extras for a hassle-free dinner later. Use ‘em in pasta dishes, pizzas, sammies, soups, stir-fries, and more, or serve them on their own for a happy appy.
