{"name":"Grilled Cuban Mojo Pork Chops","slug":"grilled-cuban-mojo-pork-chops","description":"<p>Transport your taste buds to Cuba! In Cuban cooking, “mojo” refers to any sauce made with garlic, olive oil, and citrus juice. While bitter orange juice is traditionally used, we’ve included lime juice &amp; orange peel in our blend to help achieve that authentic flavour. All you need to do is add your favourite OJ and oil to create a tangy and flavourful marinade that’s perfect for grilling. Don’t let the recipe time scare you away–marinades and meal prep go hand in hand. Marinate protein ahead as you prep for the week. When it’s time to grill, you’ll have dinner on the table in 20 min!</p>","ingredients":[{"name":"Cuban Mojo Marinade Mix","quantity":"2 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"orange juice","quantity":"<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"oil","quantity":"2 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"bone-in pork chops","quantity":"1 lb (450 g)","additionalInstruction":"about 4"}],"totalTime":"1 hr & 20 min (includes 1 hr marination)","servings":"4 servings","preparation":"<ol>\n  <li>In <a data-item-id=\"38e9c45d-465e-4a8b-8c16-5f437f361347\" href=\"\">Round</a> or <a data-item-id=\"bd092c36-a4ba-5b73-9abc-fa95c0102e9a\" href=\"\">Multipurpose Steamer</a>, whisk together marinade mix, juice, and oil.</li>\n  <li>Add pork to steamer; flip to coat.
