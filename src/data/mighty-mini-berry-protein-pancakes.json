{"name":"Mighty Mini Berry Protein Pancakes","slug":"mighty-mini-berry-protein-pancakes","description":"<p>Power up with 25 g of plant-based protein. Make these pancakes for a post-workout breakie to help you recover and keep you fuelled for that great day ahead! Because the batter is made with protein powder (with no added flour), it’s best to make mini cakes—they hold together better and are much easier to flip! Also, the batter doesn’t have added sugar; all the sweetness comes from fruit. And, just like a great workout, for best results, cook low and slow to avoid burning.</p>","ingredients":[{"name":"large fresh or frozen strawberries","quantity":"4","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"large banana","quantity":"<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"egg","quantity":"1","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"unsweetened almond, oat, or soy milk","quantity":"2 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"vanilla extract","quantity":"<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> tsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Power Up Vanilla Protein Blend or Power Up Chocolate Protein Blend or Power Up Salted Caramel Protein Blend","quantity":"2 scoops","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"Apple Pie Spice or Cinnamon","quantity":"<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"oil","quantity":"1 tsp","additionalInstruction":"divided"},{"name":"maple syrup","quantity":"2 tbsp","additionalInstruction":null},{"name":"berries or 1 cup unsweetened apple sauce","quantity":"2 cups","additionalInstruction":null}],"totalTime":"20 min","servings":"2 servings","preparation":"<ol>\n  <li>Chop strawberries and place in a bowl.
