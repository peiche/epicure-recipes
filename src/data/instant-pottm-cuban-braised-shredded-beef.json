{"name":"Instant Pot™ Cuban Braised Shredded Beef","slug":"instant-pottm-cuban-braised-shredded-beef","description":"<p>Inspired by a Cuban favourite <em>Ropa&nbsp;Vieja</em>, the name translates as “old rags” as the shreds of crumpled beef resemble them. The classic recipe is a saucy mix of meat, sweet bell peppers, onion and tangy olives. It’s typically made with flank steak, but we love how pot roast guarantees tender, flavourful juicy shreds. We also love the time-saving, hands-off Instant Pot™ approach versus simmering away for hours on the stovetop. This dish is very rich – so a little goes a long way!
